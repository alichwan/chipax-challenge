# chipax-challenge

Rick and Morty challenge for Chipax by Pavel - Jul 2022

## Start

First, install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the local server (port 3000)

```bash
nodemon index.js
```

And thats it, now you can make get request to the endpoints.

## Important

In order to run both excercises you must provide a episode id in the url. For example, `localhost:3000/51`. Without this parameter only the firs excercise will run.

## Tests

Implemented for some non-asynchronous functions using jest.
